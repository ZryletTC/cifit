# CIFIT
A program for fitting data from a selective inversion relaxation experiment on a system undergoing slow chemical exchange

This repository is based on the work of Alex D. Bain at McMaster University, who wrote the initial through 2.0 versions of the program in C.
Version 2.0 is included as a tagged release here, and all future versions of the code are reproductions in Python.
